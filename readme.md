# Make Your Bot GO! With JavaScript!

BoEBot.js is a library for the Parallax ["Board of Education" bot
for Arduino](http://www.parallax.com/StoreSearchResults/tabid/768/List/0/SortField/4/ProductID/820/Default.aspx), 
running on top of Rick Waldron's [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five)
framework and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). It aims to simplify the
commands needed to make your bot move, so you don't have to manange the
speed of each servo independently.
